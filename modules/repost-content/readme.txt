The easiest way to discover and republish complete, fully licensed articles on your own site. Free!


== Description ==

**The featues of this plugin are now included into the [Repost](http://wordpress.org/plugins/repostus/) plugin. Simply update your installed Repost plugin to version 4.x to receive the functions of this plugin. If you do not want to share your posts/articles and still be able to repost millions of articles, install this Repost Content plugin as a stand alone product.**

Have you ever seen an article on another website that you wanted to republish but couldn’t figure out how to do it easily and legally?

We did too, so we created the [Repost](http://www.repost.us) platform, which allows you to republish complete, fully licensed articles on your own site (including images, links, and movies) anywhere quickly, easily, and legally – just like video.
